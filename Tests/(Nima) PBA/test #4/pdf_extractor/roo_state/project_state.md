# ðŸ§­ Project State

> Maintained and updated by Orchestrator. This is the central source of truth and context for all agents.

## Project Name:
PDF Credit Card Expense Extractor

## Purpose:
Build a standalone Python CLI app that extracts credit card expenses from PDF files, identifying transaction date, merchant description, and amount per transaction.

---

## Project Stages:
- bootstrapping
- MVP building
- debugging & stabilization
- refactoring
- maintenance

(*These stages are predefined and should be referenced in the "Current Stage" below.*)

---

## Current Stage:
MVP building

---

## Architecture Summary:
Complete 4-layer modular architecture implemented: CLI Interface, Application Core, Data Processing, and Foundation layers. System uses pdfplumber exclusively for PDF extraction with Avianca pattern recognition, ground truth validation, and extensible plugin architecture.

---

## External Dependencies:
- Python 3
- pdfplumber library
- Ground truth validation data (ground_truth.json)
- Base PDFs located in ground_truth/base_pdfs/

(*Core dependency on pdfplumber for PDF text extraction and processing.*)

---

## Active Goal:
Implementation phase completed - system ready for testing and validation with actual PDF files

---

## Agents Involved:
- Orchestrator (coordination)
- Architect (design)
- Code (implementation)
- Debug (testing)

(*List which Roo modes are currently expected to act.*)

---

- [x] Design system architecture (Architect) - COMPLETED
- [x] Implement core PDF parsing logic - COMPLETED
- [x] Build pattern recognition system - COMPLETED
- [x] Create CLI interface - COMPLETED
- [x] Implement validation against ground truth - COMPLETED
- [x] Build learning system for new patterns - COMPLETED
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with actual PDF files - NEXT

(*Update this list frequently; completed tasks can be moved to a different section if needed.*)

---

## Known Blockers:
- None currently identified

---

## Last Agent Updates:
- Architect @ 2025-01-11 | Completed system architecture design with 17-section comprehensive document | hash: arch001
- Code @ 2025-01-11 | Implemented complete CLI application with all core modules and validation system | hash: impl001

(*Compact log of last actions. Keep only most recent 1â€“2 updates per agent. Orchestrator is responsible for updating this.*)

---

## Progress Log:

## Project Specifications:

### Input Requirements:
- Six text-based PDFs from one known card issuer
- PDFs located in ground_truth/base_pdfs/

### Output Requirements:
- CLI table format with columns: Date, Description, Amount (in COP)
- Support for both single file processing and batch folder processing

### Validation Requirements:
- Must match expected totals and transaction counts from ground_truth.json
- Extract exactly the transaction counts and totals specified in the ground truth

### Core Features:
- Single file processing capability
- Batch folder processing capability
- Pattern learning system for new PDF formats
- CLI interface for user interaction
- Validation system against ground truth data
- Learning system for teaching new PDF patterns

## Notes:
Project builds upon previous test iterations (#1, #2, #3). Focus on robust pattern recognition for credit card transaction extraction with emphasis on validation accuracy against established ground truth data. System should be extensible for learning new PDF formats. Location: Tests/(Nima)\ PBA/test\ #4/pdf_extractor/
