# Logging Instructions:
- Always append new entries in YAML list format
- Never delete or overwrite past entries â€” this log is append-only
- Maintain strict indentation and structure
- `hash_id` format suggestion: [mode_abbr]_[sequential_id], e.g., `orchestrator_001`
- Required fields: `date`, `task`, `input_from`, `result`, `next_step`, `author`, `hash_id`
- Optional: `details:` â€” use for rationale, links, affected files, etc.

- date: 2025-01-07
  task: Design complete system architecture for PDF Credit Card Expense Extractor CLI application
  input_from: project_state.md, ground_truth.json, user requirements
  result: Created comprehensive system architecture document with 17 sections covering all components, data flow, patterns, CLI design, validation framework, error handling, extensibility, and deployment strategy. Corrected to focus exclusively on pdfplumber as requested.
  next_step: Request Orchestrator to assign Code mode for implementation phase
  author: Architect
  hash_id: arch_001
  details:
    files_created:
      - roo_state/Architect/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
    architecture_components:
      - CLI Interface Layer (command parser, user interface, output formatter)
      - Application Core Layer (PDF parser, pattern engine, validator)
      - Data Processing Layer (PDFPlumber extractor, pattern matcher, data formatter)
      - Foundation Layer (configuration, logging, error handling)
    key_features_designed:
      - Modular plugin architecture for extensibility
      - PDFPlumber-focused text extraction with optimized settings
      - Pattern recognition system with learning capabilities
      - Comprehensive validation against ground truth data
      - Robust CLI interface with multiple processing modes
      - Performance optimization and error handling strategies
    validation_targets_addressed:
      - AV-MC-02-FEB-2025: $434,980.00, 5 transactions
      - AV-MC-03-MAR-2025: $44,900.00, 2 transactions
      - AV-MC-04-ABR-2025: $1,068,097.00, 9 transactions
      - AV-VS-02-FEB-2025: $1,702,961.00, 18 transactions
      - AV-VS-03-MAR-2025: $810,460.00, 14 transactions
      - AV-VS-04-ABR-2025: $1,058,980.00, 20 transactions
    observations:
      - Architecture supports all specified requirements
      - Designed exclusively for Python 3 with pdfplumber library
      - Extensible pattern system allows for new card issuers
      - Comprehensive testing strategy included
      - Ready for implementation phase
    corrections_made:
      - Removed references to PyMuPDF and PyPDF2
      - Focused architecture solely on pdfplumber
      - Updated requirements.txt to include only pdfplumber
      - Simplified extraction layer to single PDFPlumber extractor
