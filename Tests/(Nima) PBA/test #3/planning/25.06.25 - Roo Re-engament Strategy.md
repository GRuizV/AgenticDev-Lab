# 🤖 Roo Re-engagement Strategy – Test #3

## 🎯 Goal
Define a clean, sustainable plan to reintroduce Roo agents to help **complete, test, and extend** the PDF Expense Extractor in Test #3 without chaos, duplication, or drift.

## ⚙️ Roo Usage Issues in Test #3

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🌀 Overlap between human and agent changes | Roo agents scaffolded without preserving intent or history |
| 📂 File placement unclear | Roo output files mixed into `debug/` or top-level folders |
| 🧠 Agent memory not preserved | No persistent logs or summaries from each Roo session |
| ⚒️ Task design too open-ended | Prompts like “build the parser” led to sprawling diffs |
| 🧾 No task result checkpoints | Roo outcomes were not committed or tagged between stages |

---

## 🧩 Recommended Roo Workflow Architecture

### 🗂️ Folder Usage

| Folder | Agent Role |
|--------|------------|
| `/planning/` | Store `.roo` prompts, task breakdowns, summaries |
| `/agent_logs/` | All `.md` results and feedback from Roo |
| `/prompts/` | Reusable example prompts and outcomes (can version) |
| `/debug_logs/` | Any Roo-generated test traces, failures, logs |

---

## 📁 File Conventions

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Track decisions and task summaries (agent + human) |
| `roo_trace_log.md` | Raw stream of all Roo steps (one per session if needed) |
| `.roorules-*.md` | Encapsulate reusable prompting logic: parser patterns, validation rules, etc. |

---

## 🧠 Mode Configuration Guidance

| Setting | Recommended Behavior |
|--------|------------------------|
| `Orchestrator (Guided)` | Central planner, slow-paced, logs everything |
| `Code` | Only touches scoped files, defers planning |
| `Think` *(optional)* | For planning/alternatives if complexity rises again |
| `Documentator` *(optional)* | Finalizes summaries or generates release notes |

## 🔄 Roo Task Flow (Boomerang Style)


### User → 🧭 Orchestrator:

    1. Define scoped task: “Refactor CLI interface to connect to main”
    2. Orchestrator delegates to 🧑‍💻 Code
    3. Code implements, writes `attempt_completion` summary
    4. Orchestrator logs result, asks user to approve or roll back
    5. Log preserved to `/agent_logs/`

### 🔒 Ground Rules for Roo Tasks
    🔹 Only one task at a time.
    🔹 Explicit file targets required.
    🔹 Summaries stored in agent_logs, changelog updated.
    🔹 No scaffold or “guess what I mean” prompts.
    🔹 Resume after every attempt_completion.

### First Tasks to Delegate
    ✅ Refactor cli_interface.py to invoke main() properly.
    ✅ Ensure main.py runs end-to-end using pdf_parser_factory.
    ✅ Add argparse to replace hardcoded input/output paths.
    ✅ Export extracted transactions to CSV.
    ✅ Validate output against expected_results.py from CLI.


## 📌 Summary

This structure will:

    * Clarify ownership between user vs agent.
    * Stabilize workspace hygiene.
    * Enable repeatable, multi-phase contributions.
    * Prepare for future agent collaboration and CI workflows.
