# Tests Summary

## Test #1
    
    - **Purpose**: Validate feasibility of extracting expenses from a structured PDF using a Python CLI app.

    - **Input**: Text-based credit card PDF from a known issuer (sample format controlled).

    - **Extraction target**: 
    
        * Date in DD MM YY format (e.g., 21 04 25)
        * Description (e.g., HOMECENTER VTAS A DIST BOGOTA)
        * Amount in COP format with $ and commas (e.g., $704,700.00)

    - **Expected output**: CLI table listing one row per expense with the extracted fields.

    - **Scope**: No categorization, export, or inference logic â€” just raw extraction and tabular display.
