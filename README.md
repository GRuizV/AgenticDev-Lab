# ðŸ§  Agentic Development Lab

This repository documents the structured, day-by-day learning process of experimenting with **Roo Code** and **agentic development workflows**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Learn by doing: experiment with Roo's agent model in real tasks.
- Understand internal agent orchestration, delegation, memory handling, and tool use.
- Document learnings, workflows, and decisions in daily journal entries.
- Build a public knowledge trail to reflect growth and contribute back to the community.
- Prepare to apply these agentic methods to real software projects (e.g., Nima startup).


## ðŸ§¾ Usage

- Use it to track your own Roo experiments.
- Fork it if you want to build your own learning archive.
- Submit issues if you'd like feedback.
