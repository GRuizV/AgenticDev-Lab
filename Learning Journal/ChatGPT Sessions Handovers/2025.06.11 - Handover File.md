# 🧭 Roo Copilot – Session Context Snapshot

## 📌 Project Title:
**Learning Agentic Development with Roo**

## 🧑‍💻 User Goal:
To learn how to build real applications using agentic workflows with Roo — starting small and gradually mastering orchestration, tool usage, persistence, and prompt strategy.

## 📂 Current Working Mode:
- **Mode:** `🧭 Orchestrator (Guided)`
- **Behavior:** Slows down task execution, explains reasoning before delegation, confirms user approval, follows Boomerang-style task routing

## 🧱 Agent Configuration Summary:
- Custom mode defined in `custom_modes.yaml`
- `roleDefinition`: Identity-focused
- `customInstructions`: Behavior logic, Boomerang policy, and human-in-the-loop flow
- Task summaries written to: `reports/{task_name}_summary.md`

## 🪃 Orchestration Pattern:
- Uses **Boomerang Task Policy**
- Each delegated mode must return with a result (no further delegation)
- Summary and continuation are managed by the orchestrator

## 📘 Learning Journal:
- Repo: `roo-learning-journal`
- Format: One `.md` file per session
- Entries include: Topics Covered, Resources, Experiments, Concepts, Outputs

## 🧪 Latest Session Summary (2025-06-11):
- Completed Boonstra’s Prompt Engineering whitepaper
- Integrated Boomerang policy into orchestrator mode
- Aligned mode config with Roo’s standard instruction design
- Analyzed context overflow issues in Roo
- Established phase-based development strategy
- Clarified token context bar behavior
- Discussed persistence via summary files between tasks

## ⛓️ Project Continuation Strategy:
- Treat each Roo task as a **phase**
- Begin each task by reading relevant summary files
- Use minimal in-context history to avoid overflow
- Modularize logic, scaffolds, and orchestration rules

## 📎 Suggested Next Steps:
- Begin using Roo on a real scaffolded app (start with CLI or backend script)
- Test summary file bridging across 2–3 tasks
- Refactor prompt logic into `.roorules-*` for reusability
