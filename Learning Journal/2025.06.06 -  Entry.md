# 🧠 Learning Log — 2025-06-06

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Roo mode creation and orchestration flow
- Agent vs Mode terminology
- Setting up `Orchestrator (Guided)` with reflective delegation
- Reviewing Reddit community best practices

## 🔎 Resources Reviewed
- Reddit Thread: “My $0 Roo Code setup for the best results”
- Reddit Thread: “Anyone interested in an updated tutorial for setting up RooCode”
- Roo toolchain: `memory_bank`, `.md`, MCP, Roo Flow

## 🧪 Experiments Conducted
- Created and tested a custom `Orchestrator (Guided)` agent with prompt-level slowdown behavior.
- Tasked Roo with building a water tracker CLI with human-in-the-loop control.
- Observed agent delegation behavior and file generation (`water_tracker.py`, `learning_log.md`).

## 🧩 Concepts Clarified
- What is a Roo workflow (agent handoff, orchestration, task decomposition)
- How persistence works across sessions using memory, files, and tools
- Core agentic development terms: agent, mode, orchestrator, workflow, delegation

## 🔧 Outputs Produced
- `Orchestrator (Guided)` mode prompt and logic
- Test output file: `water_tracker.py`
- Setup structure plan for `roo-learning-journal` GitHub repo
