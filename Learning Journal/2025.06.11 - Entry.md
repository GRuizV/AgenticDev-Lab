# ðŸ§  Learning Log â€” 2025-06-11

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Completed review of Lee Boonstraâ€™s whitepaper on Prompt Engineering (2025 edition)
- Reviewed official Roo documentation on Boomerang Tasks and mode design
- Clarified difference between Boomerang pattern and guided Orchestrator mode
- Compared `roleDefinition` vs `customInstructions` placement in Roo custom modes
- Reviewed how to adopt Rooâ€™s documentation-style instruction architecture
- Analyzed context window usage and overflow errors in Roo
- Established phase-based planning strategy for agentic development in Roo

## ðŸ”Ž Resources Reviewed
- Whitepaper: *Prompt Engineering â€“ Boonstra (2025)* (PDF)
- Roo Docs: [Boomerang Tasks](https://docs.roocode.com/features/boomerang-tasks)

## ðŸ§ª Experiments Conducted
- Refactored `orchestrator-guided` config to match Rooâ€™s best practices:
  - Boomerang delegation policy
  - Human-in-the-loop pacing
  - Task summary generation
- Visualized context window usage using Roo's UI
- Explored how to avoid context overflow in long agentic sessions

## ðŸ§© Concepts Clarified
- Difference between chained vs boomerang task delegation
- How Rooâ€™s `customInstructions` field behaves vs `roleDefinition`
- What causes `"input length and max tokens exceed context limit"` errors
- How Roo resets context between tasks and how to bridge knowledge safely
- Strategy for persisting knowledge across long projects via summary markdowns

## ðŸ”§ Outputs Produced
- Hybrid-format `orchestrator-guided` configuration with modular `customInstructions`
- Design guideline for `.roorules-*` file structure
- Planning approach for multi-phase agentic projects with file-based context carryover
