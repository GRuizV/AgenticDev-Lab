# 🧠 Learning Log — 2025-06-09

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Roo mode creation and orchestration flow
- Agent vs Mode terminology
- Setting up `Orchestrator (Guided)` with reflective delegation
- Reviewing Reddit community best practices
- Initial exploration of ReAct framework and LangChain agent setup

## 🔎 Resources Reviewed
- Reddit Thread: “My $0 Roo Code setup for the best results”
- Reddit Thread: “Anyone interested in an updated tutorial for setting up RooCode”
- Roo toolchain: `memory_bank`, `.md`, MCP, Roo Flow
- LangChain ReAct framework via `AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`
- LLM backends: VertexAI, OpenAI, TogetherAI

## 🧪 Experiments Conducted
- Created and tested a custom `Orchestrator (Guided)` agent with prompt-level slowdown behavior.
- Tasked Roo with building a water tracker CLI with human-in-the-loop control.
- Observed agent delegation behavior and file generation (`water_tracker.py`, `learning_log.md`).
- Attempted multiple LLM integrations with LangChain for ReAct-style agent testing.
- Managed version conflicts, dependency alignment, and LLM authentication for TogetherAI + SerpAPI.

## 🧩 Concepts Clarified
- What is a Roo workflow (agent handoff, orchestration, task decomposition)
- How persistence works across sessions using memory, files, and tools
- Core agentic development terms: agent, mode, orchestrator, workflow, delegation
- ReAct loop pattern: Thought → Action → Observation → Final Answer
- Trade-offs and friction points in multi-backend LLM workflows

## 🔧 Outputs Produced
- `Orchestrator (Guided)` mode prompt and logic
- Test output file: `water_tracker.py`
- Setup structure plan for `roo-learning-journal` GitHub repo
- Draft ReAct agent script using TogetherAI and SerpAPI (to be completed next session)
