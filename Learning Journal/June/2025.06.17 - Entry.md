# 📘 Roo Learning Log – June 17, 2025

## 🧑‍💻 Session Overview
**Mode:** OCR Testing / CLI Refactor  
**Project:** PDF Expense Extractor  
**Context:** Focused on implementing and validating OCR-based pipeline for scanned PDF statements

---

## ✅ Summary of Work

- Replaced direct text extraction with **OCR-based parsing** using `Tesseract` and `pdf2image`
- Processed 6 sample image-based PDFs (MC & VS formats)
- Built modular components:
  - `pdf_expense_extractor.py`: CLI OCR pipeline
  - `batch_test_pdfs.py`: bulk file processor
  - `dependency_config.py`: dynamic setup for Tesseract/Poppler
- Output accuracy suffered:
  - Extraction worked on all files
  - **Performance significantly worse than Test #1 (text-based)** due to OCR misreads

---

## 📁 Outputs Generated
- Full working OCR pipeline script
- Config + test tooling
- Clean file structure and project report (`PROJECT_SUMMARY_REPORT.md`)

---

## 🧠 Key Lessons
- OCR is viable for scanned PDFs but highly dependent on input quality
- Regex logic remained structurally intact, but value accuracy degraded
- File access, platform config, and batch handling are now robust
- Direct text extraction is still **superior** for supported files

---

## 🪜 Next Steps
- Investigate hybrid approach: prefer text, fallback to OCR
- Add OCR quality validation step
- Explore performance improvements and output correction
- Begin export/categorization feature planning

---

📌 **Status:** OCR-based pipeline functional, but inferior to previous text-based extractor
