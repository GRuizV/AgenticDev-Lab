# 📘 Roo Learning Log – June 16, 2025

## 🧑‍💻 Session Overview
**Mode:** Agentic Planning (Exploratory Work)  
**Focus:** Define and implement a PoC CLI tool with Roo  
**Context:** Standalone mini-project outside Phase 1–3 plan

---

## 🔍 Session Goal
Define and prepare a Proof of Concept (PoC) project for Roo:
> 🧾 Extract expense data from a known-format credit card bill PDF using regex and text parsing.

---

## ✅ Key Decisions

### 1. Project Scope
- Handle only one known card issuer format
- Extract only essential fields: date, description, amount
- No categorization, filtering, export, or CLI arguments (yet)

### 2. Format & Pattern
- Line structure:  
  `"4290 21 04 25 HOMECENTER VTAS A DIST BOGOTA 25.61 $704,700.00 $704,700.00 $0.00 01 01 00"`
- Fields extracted:
  - **Date** → `21 04 25`
  - **Description** → `HOMECENTER VTAS A DIST BOGOTA`
  - **Amount** → `$704,700.00`
- All values in COP (Colombian Pesos), dollar symbol used

### 3. Tools Chosen
- **PDF Parsing:** `pdfplumber`
- **Pattern Extraction:** `re` (regex)
- **CLI Output:** `tabulate`

### 4. Output Design
- No CLI args for now — input path hardcoded
- Cleanly printed table using `tabulate`
- Modular, readable script with ~234 LOC

---

## 🧪 Roo Prompt & Execution
- Roo was guided with a structured planning prompt including:
  - Goal, Scope, Context, Instructions
  - Regex-based extraction emphasis
  - Simplicity > generality for PoC phase

- Roo successfully scaffolded a working tool:
  - Parsed PDF
  - Extracted required fields
  - Displayed in clean CLI table
  - Contained error handling and structured flow

---

## 🔄 Alternatives & Deferred Paths

| Consideration | Deferred |
|---------------|----------|
| Pattern inference from raw text | ❌ (use controlled input first) |
| Multi-format / multi-issuer support | 🔜 Phase 2+ |
| OCR fallback | 🤔 Only if required |
| Categorization of expenses | ⏳ Post-MVP |
| Export to CSV/JSON | 🔜 Phase 2 |

---

## 🧭 Learning Objectives Met
- Directed Roo to plan and execute a focused PoC
- Applied real-world parsing logic in a constrained CLI app
- Balanced simplicity vs extensibility
- Created a foundation for structured project evolution

---

## 🔜 Next Steps (Suggested)
- Run tool on multiple PDFs and gather edge/failure cases
- Add CSV/JSON export or categorization logic
- Modularize parsing pattern config
- Design next phase prompt for Roo
