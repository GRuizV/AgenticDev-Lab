# üß† Learning Log ‚Äî 2025-06-10

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered
- Explored Roo‚Äôs official documentation at https://docs.roocode.com
- Reviewed Roo‚Äôs core architecture: modes, tools, task lifecycle, orchestration
- Clarified behavior of approval/rejection flow in tool execution
- Investigated how Roo uses browser tools for search and scraping
- Discussed persistence models: task memory, directory review, memory banks
- Proposed best practice: generate summary reports per task (`reports/*.md`)

## üß© Concepts Clarified
- Approving vs rejecting tool actions and what happens on each path
- What it means to chat during an approval pause without pressing buttons
- How and when Roo uses the browser tool
- Two ways to continue past work: reopening a task vs asking Roo to reanalyze the folder
- Effective structuring of long-lived mode instructions
- Ideal format for `.roorules-*` files: Behavior, Tone, Output Format, Post-Task Actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Experiments and Ideas
- Validated that generating task summaries as `.md` files improves continuity
- Structured a reusable template for Roo mode rule files
- Reviewed and refactored the "Orchestrator (Guided)" role definition
- Distinguished between Role Definition and Mode-Specific Instructions
- Decided to formalize `.roorules-orchestrator.md` using these insights

## üîß Outputs and Next Steps
- Updated orchestration philosophy with clarity and structure
- Next step: generate structured `.roorules-orchestrator.md`
- Continue reviewing Roo's official docs for advanced mode coordination and workflows
