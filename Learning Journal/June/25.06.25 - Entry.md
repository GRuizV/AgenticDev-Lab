# 📘 Roo Learning Log – June 20, 2025

## 🧑‍💻 Session Overview
**Mode:** Diagnostic & Refactoring Planning  
**Project:** Personal Billing Assistant (PBA) – Test #3  
**Focus:** Understanding system structure, identifying weak spots, and preparing for structured Roo re-engagement

---

## ✅ Key Actions

### 🧭 System Walkthrough
- Inspected all functional modules in `pdf_expense_extractor/`
- Identified clear module separation:
  - Core (CLI, validator, detector)
  - Parsers (pluggable backends)
  - Utils (date, amount, text normalization)
  - Config (patterns, expected results)
- Highlighted that `main.py` appears central, but its flow and CLI invocation need verification

### 🔧 Evaluation of Implementation
- Strong design principles (modularity, extensibility, SRP)
- Lacked CLI integration validation, test structure, result export, and agentic traceability
- Identified missing or weak components:
  - Validation loop across CLI
  - Export and trend tracking
  - Persistent Roo trace or changelog
  - Explicit testing harness (no `pytest`)

## 📁 Output Artifacts
1. ✅ System Walkthrough Summary (`System Walkthrough – Test #3`)
2. ✅ Full Improvement Plan (`Improvement Plan – Test #3`)
3. ✅ Roo Re-engagement Plan (`Roo Re-engagement Strategy – Test #3`)

---

## 🔁 Status
- Project analysis complete
- Recommendations and structure preserved
- Roo re-entry plan finalized and deferred

📌 **Next Move:** Resume when ready by selecting one of the five proposed Roo agentic subtasks to execute.
