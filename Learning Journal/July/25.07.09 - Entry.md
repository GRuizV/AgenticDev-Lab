# 🧾 Roo System Finalization Summary – July 5th, 2025

## ✅ Phase Completion: Phase 2 - System Behavior

Finalized and operationalized the Roo agentic collaboration system by:

---

## 🏗️ SYSTEM DESIGN & INFRASTRUCTURE

- **Refined `project_state.md`** logic:
  - Clarified that placeholder content should be overwritten only when Orchestrator is explicitly instructed
  - Decided not to auto-initialize or clean unless prompted

- **Confirmed startup and scaffolding flow**:
  - Added human bootstrap ritual as standalone `SETUP.md` concept
  - Decided not to embed setup in the core `README.md`

- **Defined a clear launch ritual** with:
  - `.roo-config.yaml`
  - Manual SOPF assignment
  - Initial prompt structure
  - Project renaming guidance

---

## 🧭 FINALIZED ORCHESTRATOR BEHAVIOR

- Integrated **Boomerang Policy** explicitly
- Added clause to:
  - Detect placeholder state
  - Trigger project bootstrap
  - Generate final `README.md` at `pj_directory/` upon completion

---

## 📄 LOG SYSTEM HARDENED

- Created and embedded per-mode example entries in each `mode_log.md`
- Enforced:
  - One log per atomic task
  - No mid-task entries
  - Post-task Git-style logging only
- Clarified Ask does not log by default

---

## 📘 DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED & LOCKED

- Audited and finalized full system-level `README.md` with:
  - Updated role logic
  - Coordination etiquette
  - Logging schema
  - Launch instructions
  - Mermaid diagram

- Reviewed and confirmed `roo_state/README.md` as scoped and sufficient

---

## 🧠 PHILOSOPHICAL CHECKPOINTS

- Reaffirmed: this system mirrors Git principles by necessity, not preference
- Recognized: system is modular and auditable — not just engineered, but maintainable

---

## 🟢 System Status

- ✅ All SOPFs written and finalized
- ✅ `README.md` and all scaffolding files in place
- ✅ `.roo-config.yaml` and mode settings aligned
- 🧪 Ready for Phase 3: Dry Test Execution
