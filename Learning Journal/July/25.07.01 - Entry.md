# ðŸ“˜ Roo Learning Log â€“ July 1, 2025

## ðŸ§­ Session Overview
**Focus:** Deep-dive understanding of Roo's architecture and preparation for custom mode configuration  
**Phase:** A â€“ System Mechanics & Prompt Design

---

## âœ… Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Roo System Prompt Internals**
- Reviewed the full system prompt used by the built-in Orchestrator
- Confirmed it includes all logic, behavior, tools, and constraints injected into each model instance
- Clarified that `roleDefinition + customInstructions + system rules` â†’ the true prompt sent to OpenRouter

### 2. **Mode Isolation**
- Each Roo mode (Code, Orchestrator, etc.) uses its own LLM instance
- No shared memory between agents â€” unless explicitly passed
- System prompts are not shared or inherited

### 3. **Tool Execution Mechanism**
- Agents emit structured XML tool calls (`<edit_file>`, `<execute_command>`, etc.)
- Roo's VSCode extension parses and executes these safely
- File writes and terminal commands are not generated directly â€” only through tools

### 4. **Problem Identified: Command Chaining**
- Roo agents emit `cd ... && command` style tool calls
- On user's Windows/VSCode setup, this fails
- Roo then retries in multiple API calls, wasting cost and time

---

## ðŸ›  Decision: Mode-wide Custom Instruction Fix
A shared constraint will be added to all relevant modes to:
- Prohibit command chaining
- Require separate `cd` and command execution

This will reduce retries and token usage.

## ðŸ“Œ Tomorrowâ€™s Plan

### Objective: Customize Rooâ€™s Five Built-in Modes
**Focus:**
- ðŸ§¼ Reduce verbosity and redundant summaries
- ðŸ§  Secure collaborative traceability between modes
- ðŸ§­ Use default Orchestrator with only Boomerang logic added
- ðŸ—‚ Require clear changelogs, `agent_logs/`, and rationale-tracking in every mode

Ready for Phase B tomorrow: **customizing the five built-in Roo modes for clarity, efficiency, and collaboration.**
