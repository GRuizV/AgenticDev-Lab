## 🧑‍💻 Session Overview
**Mode:** Orchestrator (Guided)  
**Focus:** Roo concepts review, agent design decisions, and multi-phase project planning

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🔍 Feature & Concept Reviews
- ✅ *Context Poisoning*
- ✅ *Working with Large Projects*
- ✅ *Prompt Engineering*
- ✅ *Enhance Prompt*
- ✅ *Intelligent Context Condensation*
- ❓ Discussed reasons **not** to use context condensation

### 🧠 Design Discussions
- 📌 Whether a **dedicated `Think` agent** is necessary  
  → Conclusion: No, not yet — Orchestrator is sufficient for now
- 📌 Whether to introduce a **`Documentator` agent**  
  → Decision: Defer until workflows become heavier

### 🪧 UX Preference Set
- Learning logs will now always be shown in raw `.md` format in-chat

## 📦 Project Planning (Multi-Phase Setup)

### 💧 Phase 1 – *Water Tracker CLI Extensions*
- Reviewed existing CLI app + Roo scaffolding
- Defined confirmed feature upgrades:
  - JSON persistence
  - CSV logging
  - Daily total reporting
  - Goal tracking
  - Summary exports
  - PNG chart with trendline
- Logged a complete scoped one-pager

### 🔀 Phase 2 – *Git Practice Project*
- Outlined goal: learn Git branching, merging, reverts through a toy CLI
- Project ideas proposed (task manager, note CLI, expense tracker, etc.)
- Waiting on final project selection to begin

### 🚀 Phase 3 – *Real-World Agentic Project*
- Purpose: stress test Roo on a real build
- Set constraints: at least 3 Roo phases, persistent memory, `.roorules-*`, real outputs
- Candidate domain still open

## 🪜 Next Steps
- Pick feature 1.1 for Phase 1 (to send to Roo)
- Decide CLI theme for Phase 2 Git practice
- Brainstorm candidate project for Phase 3 real use
