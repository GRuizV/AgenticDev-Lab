# ðŸ§ª Shared Tests Log

This file tracks all test files created or modified inside `pj_directory/tests/`.  
It is shared between Code and Debug agents and documents the reasoning, assumptions, and scope behind each test.  
All entries must be appended in structured YAML format.

## Logging Instructions
- Append new entries using structured YAML list format.
- Do not overwrite or remove previous entries.
- Fields `test_file`, `reason`, and `linked_feature` are mandatory.
- Use `result` to summarize execution status (e.g. scaffolded, passed, failed).
- Use `next_step` to signal intended actions or handoffs (especially to Debug).
