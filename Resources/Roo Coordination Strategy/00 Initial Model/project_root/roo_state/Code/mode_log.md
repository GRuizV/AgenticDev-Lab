# Logging Instructions:
- Always append new entries in YAML list format
- Never delete or overwrite past entries â€” this log is append-only
- Maintain strict indentation and structure
- `hash_id` format suggestion: [mode_abbr]_[sequential_id], e.g., `orchestrator_001`
- Required fields: `date`, `task`, `input_from`, `result`, `next_step`, `author`, `hash_id`
- Optional: `details:` â€” use for rationale, links, affected files, etc.
