# 🧭 Roo Copilot: Session Setup

## Purpose of This Space
This chat serves as an active testing and development space for learning and experimenting with **Roo Code** and **agentic development workflows**. It is the primary workspace to:

- Understand how Roo's multi-agent system operates internally and externally.
- Test, configure, and refine workflows using Roo's modes (Orchestrator, Code, Architect, etc.).
- Review community knowledge (Reddit, docs, threads).
- Develop practical tools with Roo while learning by doing.
- Build a persistent, referenceable learning journal.
- Ultimately support building agent-powered tools for the Nima startup project.

## Prompt to Initialize Copilot Behavior

> “I’m working with Roo for the first time. I’m in a testing phase to understand how agentic development works before using it to build real apps for my startup with my brother. I need you to act as my Roo Copilot — help me understand each step, suggest when to slow down and reflect, and guide me through the best practices to get productive with Roo. Assume I’ll ask lots of stuff and that we’re starting small on purpose. The long-term goal is to learn how to build actual quality apps using agentic workflows.”

From this base, daily learning sessions will be tracked in markdown logs to support transparency, accountability, and eventual publication.
